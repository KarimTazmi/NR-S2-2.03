                <h2>If you have a mind, you're a talent.</h2>
                <p>
                    It can be hard to decide what your next step in life should be. 
                    Old places to leave, new places to explore. What jobs are out there? What do companies look for? 
                    What skills do you need? Luckily, we know the way.
                    We believe that your mind is your ticket to a career you like. And that ticket is valid for life.

            <h2>Reshape your talent into future skills</h2>
            <p><strong>Companies are looking for people with future skills.</strong> Like creative front-end development, data storytelling or creative learning development. Our work & learn tracks make you highly attractive to
                employers. Youâ€™ll invest in a range of skills that help you grow and continue growing - in your work and
                in your personal life. And you even get paid for it.

                <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Learn to work. Work to learn.</h3>
                <p>In some tracks youâ€™ll start with a base training, which - in some cases - you can do alongside your work or 
                studies. This makes it easier to take the jump and at the end of it, youâ€™ll land on a solid foundation of skills.

                <h2>Creative front-end development - start march 2020</h2>
                <p>If you like creating things, front-end development may be for you. Itâ€™s easy to learn. Sureâ€”youâ€™ll have to put in the hours, but itâ€™s one of those skills that will give you immediate gratification:  you see what you build.
                    Itâ€™s also high in demand, low in supply. This means: a good salary, easy to land a job, and a quick road to a permanent position (if thatâ€™s what you desire). 
                    Front-end development is also highly flexible, which means you can arrange your work around the things that are important to you.

                <h2>Data storytelling - start january 2020</h2>
                <p>Do you enjoy creativity Ã¡nd technology? As a data storyteller you can do both: being creative by visualizing and technological by working with data. 
                    You will be the person that gives data driven recommendations to the business users in your organization.
                    The paid traineeship will take 2 years, starting with 3 months of intense training.                        
                    During this traineeship we will work on your soft skills (Scrum, Presentation Skills, etc.) and hard skills (SQL, Tableau, etc.)

                <h2>Creative learning development - ongoing</h2>
                <p>Learning developers have a passion for instructions and technology. How do you make impactful trainings to serve organization goals. And how can technology work for a company? 
                    All presented in a comprehensible way so that employees can learn from it. 
                    In this track, you start immediately as a trainee working for a company. You are guided by senior learning strategists that will train you in the necessary hard skills and soft skills.
